A simple but useful one; how to convert and display a number (decimal or whole) in Excel in to hours and minutes.

This is particularly useful when you're working with data that is entered in whole or part numbers - which can be the case for many users.

e.g. converting the sum of a series of cells that returns `109`,  into a displayable (and usable) string such as `1h 49m` without having to convert into time format first.

And here it is:

    =INT(A1/60)&"h " & MOD(A1,60) &"m"
   
If cell `A1` says `109`, this will display `1h 49m` - and you can change how the `h` and `m` are displayed also by simply editing the formula directly (something that custom number formatting may restrict you from doing).

It returns the hours portion in the first half of the calculcation - hence the "INT" - it doesn't do any rounding.

It returns the remainder with the same calculation in the second half, and converts that into a whole number, to use as minutes.

Join this into a string, and you can now read it like one. Therefore, you can now use formulas such as...

    ="You have " & A2 & " remaining!"
    
... to display...

    You have 1h 49m remaining!
    
... without any additional conversions to time format required.
